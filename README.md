### Hi there 👋

Front-end developer shipping small open-source utilities whenever time allows. Client work keeps me a bit quiet here, but I'm hoping to lean into the Vibe Coding wave and show up more often.

#### Self-hosted GitHub Readme Stats

The `profile/stats.svg` card is generated daily by `.github/workflows/grs.yml` using the [`readme-tools/github-readme-stats-action`](https://github.com/readme-tools/github-readme-stats-action). If you need private-contribution data, create a fine-grained PAT and expose it as `GHRS_PAT` in the repo secrets, then update the workflow to pass that secret as the token input.
